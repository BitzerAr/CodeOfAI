# Python AI Tutorias
This repository hosts the example code of the tutorials I share through the Python AI mailing list.  

Python AI provides weekly emails which will get you up and running with AI and machine learning in Python. In the mailing list, I cover key AI topics such as search algorithms, optimisation techniques, knowledge-based systems, machine learning, and deep learning. 

Python AI is free. You can sign up at https://mailchi.mp/235b0453b227/pythonai.
